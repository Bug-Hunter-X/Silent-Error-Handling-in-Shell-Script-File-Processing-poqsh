# Silent Error Handling in Shell Script

This repository demonstrates a subtle error in a shell script that silently ignores errors when processing files.  The script iterates through a list of files and attempts to print the content of each using `cat`. However, if a file is missing, the `cat` command fails, but the script continues without any indication of the error. This can lead to incorrect results or unexpected behavior, as later parts of the script might rely on the processed data.

The `bug.sh` file contains the erroneous script, while `bugSolution.sh` provides a corrected version that handles errors gracefully, printing informative messages if a file is not found or inaccessible.

This example highlights the importance of robust error handling in shell scripts, especially those dealing with external resources like files.
